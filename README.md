# Medical_Imaging
We're glad to share our Medical Imaging project. We conducted Alzheimer desease (AD)
detection based on MR images through Random Forest and CNNs approaches. You can access to the .rmd file to explore the code and download the html report. Both of them are avaiable in an english version. You can also take a look ad the dataset we used and download it to improve our project!
